Hello, I'm Alex Esc.

These documents are a shorter version of the lectures on Miller Puckette's Introduction To Computer Music.

---

Miller Puckette's Introduction To Computer Music is comprised of 20 video lectures and support material, since the lectures are **about 1 hour each** I adapted them into smaller bite sized lessons.

# What's this all about?


On Miller Puckette's Introduction To Computer Music, Professor Puckette said:

> The purpose of this course is to [...] enable you to **make your own computer music applications**, in the sense of designing electronic music instruments. What that means, [...] **is making your computer do what a guitar or a drum set does**.

# Who is Miller Puckette?

The original author of a graphical programing language for music and video called `Max/MSP` as short for "Max Signal Processing", (or his initials: Miller Smith Puckette).

---

## About Max


In 1985 Puckette began to work on `Max/Msp` and it launched commercially in 1997 under the company _Cyclying '74_.

Puckette sold the publishing rights to _Cyclying '74_ on _Max's_ release, today the latest version of Max costs $399 USD.


---




Thankfully for us, in 1996 Miller Puckette independently from _Cyclying '74_ re-wrote Max and released it for free, this new software is called `pd` or _Pure Data_, pure data has been a crucial part of _Cyclying '74's_ Max releases.

And in 2011 he taught at the University of California a course called _Introduction To Computer Music_, which focused heavily on learning the basics of `pd`.

# Max is a big deal


Ableton live co-creator Robert Henke said that Max was used to prototype almost all audio devices inside live and on June 6 of 2017 Ableton bought Cyclying '74 and integrated Max with Ableton live.

`Max/Msp` and `pd` are used by musicians and artists worldwide to create electronic music, computer graphics for live events, video game audio design and more.

### Computer music, tree schools of though:

# Synthesis, signal processing & Analysis

---


# Synthesis

Creating waves via algebraic equations.

**In synthesis your input is not sound and your output is sound.**

> You create a sound from a signal, like an electric piano: you press a key (binary input) and the keyboard synthesizes (creates) a sound.

---


# signal processing

Taking a sound and turning in into something else, like sampling.

**Has both sound input and sound output**

> You take a sound and modify it in some way, like sampling: you record a sound input and you play it on a different time, therefore creating a sound output different from the original.

---

# Analysis

identifying descriptive parameters of a sound, like a sound envelope.

**Has sound input, no sound output**

> You measure a sound and get information out of it, for example a noise envelope receives sound and if it's louder than a certain level it let's us know if an instrument is playing our not (binary information).

## Computers get along easy with synthesis, so let's synthesize!
