Muting
</H2>

<P>
The
<A NAME="4634"></A><I>muting</I>
technique is to apply an envelope to the output amplitude, which is quickly
ramped to zero before the parameter change and then restored afterward.  It
may or may not be the case that the discontinuous changes will result in a signal
that rises smoothly from zero afterward. In Figure <A HREF="#fig04.05">4.5</A> (part a),
we take the example of an amplitude envelope (the output signal of an ADSR
generator), and assume that the discontinuous change is to start a new note at
amplitude zero.

<P>

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="fig04.05"></A><A NAME="4639"></A>
<TABLE>
<CAPTION ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Figure 4.5:</STRONG>
Muting technique for hiding discontinuous changes: (a) the
envelope (upper graph) is set discontinuously to zero and
the muting signal (lower graph) ramps down in advance to prepare for the change, and
then is restored (discontinuously) to its previous value; (b) the envelope
changes discontinuously between two nonzero values; the muting signal must 
both ramp down beforehand and ramp back up afterward.</CAPTION>

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
To change the ADSR generator's output discontinuously we
<A NAME="4642"></A><I>reset</I> it.  This is a different operation from triggering it; the
result is to make it jump to a new value, after which we may either simply
leave it there or trigger it anew.  Figure <A HREF="#fig04.05">4.5</A> (part a)
shows the effect of resetting and retriggering an ADSR generator.

<P>
Below the ADSR generator output we see the appropriate muting signal, which ramps to zero
to prepare for the discontinuity.  The amount of time we allow for muting
should be small (so as to disrupt the previous sound as little as possible)
but not so small as to cause audible artifacts in the output.
A working example of this type of muting was already shown on Page
<A HREF="node53.html#sect3.noloopsampler"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/local/share/lib/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>; there we allowed 5 msec for ramping down.
The muting signal is multiplied by the output of the process to be de-clicked.

<P>
Figure <A HREF="#fig04.05">4.5</A> (part b) shows the situation in which we suppose the
discontinuous change is between two possibly nonzero values.  Here the muting
signal must not only ramp down as before (in advance of the discontinuity) but
must also ramp back up afterward.  The ramp-down time need not equal the
ramp-up time; these must be chosen, as always, by listening to the output
sound.

<P>
In general, muting presents the difficulty that you must start the muting
operation in advance of making the desired control change.  In real-time
settings, this often requires that we intentionally delay the control change.
This is another reason for keeping the muting time as low as possible.  
(Moreover, it's a bad idea to try to minimize delay by conditionally
omitting the ramp-down period when it isn't needed; a constant delay
is much better than one that varies, even if it is smaller on average.)
