# About this course

These lessons are short versions of the lectures on Miller Puckette's Introduction To Computer Music.

Because Miller Puckette's Introduction To Computer Music is comprised of **20+ hours of video lectures** I adapted them into smaller bite sized lessons.

These bite sized lessons with the addition of support material form **Introduction To Computer Music - Explained**.

# Become a self-taught student

This project was born because I wanted to self-teach Pure Data, here you will find notes, resources, materials, explanations form the professor and tips from longtime `pd` users.

If you are interested in computer music, audio synthesis or multimedia programing this is a great way to start.

# Made for educators in mind


Another reason why I started this project is because I'm beginning to teach computer music to young music students on my city's local music academy. My plan is to self learn Pure Data and then pass on the knowledge to fellow music lovers, and that's why I'm releasing exercises, homeworks, class activities, annotated presentation slides & the syllabus for free to anyone interested **[as long as you respect the license, click the link below for more info]**.

_Introduction To Computer Music - Explained_ is made with the classroom in mind from the very beginning and is licensed under a classroom friendly license.

Meaning you are free to modify remix and adapt my work to create a course of your own as long as you respect our license, if you are an educator and you are interested in using this course in the classroom click the link below.
