If we've met in life you probably know me as the guy with a weird laptop. My computer was a complete mess, not because it was missing a key or the screen was cracked, my computer's hardware was doing just fine, the problem was my setup. I love tinkering with my computer, trying out new programs, changing the icon-pack, alternative shells; I tried it all at one point or another. Why? because I find it fun, I usually get some confused looks on my screen but I was doing no harm, or at least I thought at the time.

Entering university made it clear, the victim of my endless tweaks was my time and productivity, so from then onwards I set in place a new philosophy for my computer setup: the computer is a tool and the user should have the power to use it effectively to achieve his or her goals with as little input as possible.

That meant creating a streamlined experience with my setup. So I evolved one of my old scrips into 'setupesc', this is a robust autohotkey script that launches programs, folders and workspaces with keyboard shortcuts, I find setupesc so useful that my computer desktop has gone full time minimalist, no icons or menus needed.

The future goal of the project is that it will automatically install all my favorite programs and utilities in addition to serving it's regular keyboard shortcut functionality, in other words it will reproduce a somewhat similar configuration for my setup in the user's computer, that's why I called it setup-esc, well and also because my user name is alex-esc.

Setupesc it's under active development and you can find it on it's website: [getsetupesc](https://alex-esc.github.io/getsetupesc/)
