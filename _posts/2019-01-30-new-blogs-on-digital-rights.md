I will begin to publish new posts about Digital Rights, these posts will be published separately from this blog. If you head over to [digital-rights.github.io/archive][dra] you can find these new posts, here on this very blog you will find links to articles I feel particularly proud about.

For now you can check out [our first community contribution][cc]: A post about why you should switch over to Signal instead of WhatsApp.
