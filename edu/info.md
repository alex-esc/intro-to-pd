# Use this work in the classroom

Hello, I'm Alex Esc. the author of this course. I created _Introduction To Computer Music - Explained_ (or just "Explained" for short) because I wanted to teach it to young music students.

The Explained course is built from the ground up to be classroom ready, not only that nut this course was born on the classroom:

In 2011 Miller Puckette taught the class "Introduction To Computer Music" at the University of California, Professor Puckette recorded his lectures on video and released them with a transcription and several class examples.

Miller Puckette's Introduction To Computer Music is comprised of 20+ hours of video lectures, so to make his work more accessible I created the explained course as a derivative from Miller Puckette's video lectures.
