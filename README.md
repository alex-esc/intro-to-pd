# Introduction To Computer Music by Miller Puckette

## A full University course for free

In 2011 Miller Puckette taught the class "Introduction To Computer Music" at the University of California from which 20 videos were recorded during his lectures, this videos were made public for anyone to see, this cource includes video lectures, a written transcription of all the lectures and examples used on the class.

On this course professor Puckette taught how to use _pure data_, an open source visual programming language for music and multimedia, pure data (abbreviated as pd) was created by the professor himself.

## All in one place

In other words, the creator of pd made one of his classes freely available and with plenty of examples for you to learn, but this free course is strangely not known among new pd users and I don't blame them, the course is hosted in fragments, the videos are here, the examples are there and the written transcription is somewhere else. This repository aims to fix that by collecting all useful information in one place, here you will find all you need to learn pd from the author itself.

## Things you need beforehand

### Install pd

Download the pure data installer

* [Windows 64 bit](http://msp.ucsd.edu/Software/pd-0.49-0.windows-installer.exe)
* [Windows 32 bit](http://msp.ucsd.edu/Software/pd-0.49-0-i386.windows-installer.exe)
* [Mac OS X Intel/64bit](http://msp.ucsd.edu/Software/pd-0.49-1.mac.tar.gz)
* [Mac OS X Intel/32bit](http://msp.ucsd.edu/Software/pd-0.49-1-i386.mac.tar.gz)
* [Debian GNU/Linux](https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/puredata/)

## Video lectures

### Watch the video lectures on YouTube

You can stream the videos on YouTube, there are two copies of the lectures on YouTube, this is useful because if one playlist gets taken down you can use the other.

| [Playlist by sqdr][pl1] | [Playlist by toitoitoy][pl2] |

[pl2]: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRjUk6Y71rvRQa95tqspy5fdI23ReD1Cv

If in the future both playlist get deleted you will be forced to download the video lectures from what I call "the easy way" down below. Of course if you just prefer downloading the lectures rather than streaming them you can do so as well.


### Download the video lectures

The videos add up to 4.53 GB, so I could not fit them into this repository, so inside the folder 'video lectures' you will find instructions on how to download the videos for each operating system.

Windows includes a once click auto download tool, Mac and Linux require manual installation.
