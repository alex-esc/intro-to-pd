# Introduction To Computer Music by Miller Puckette

## A full University course for free

In 2011 Miller Puckette taught the class "Introduction To Computer Music" at the University of California from which 20 videos were recorded during his lectures, this videos were made public for anyone to see, this cource includes video lectures, a written transcription of all the lectures and examples used on the class.

On this course professor Puckette taught how to use _pure data_, an open source visual programming language for music and multimedia, pure data (abbreviated as pd) was created by the professor himself.

## All in one place

In other words, the creator of pd made one of his classes freely available and with plenty of examples for you to learn, but this free course is strangely not known among new pd users and I don't blame them, the course is hosted in fragments, the videos are here, the examples are there and the written transcription is somewhere else. This repository aims to fix that by collecting all useful information in one place, here you will find all you need to learn pd from the author itself.

## Things you need beforehand

### Install pd

Download the pure data installer.

* [Windows 64 bit](http://msp.ucsd.edu/Software/pd-0.49-0.windows-installer.exe)
* [Windows 32 bit](http://msp.ucsd.edu/Software/pd-0.49-0-i386.windows-installer.exe)
* [Mac OS X Intel/64bit](http://msp.ucsd.edu/Software/pd-0.49-1.mac.tar.gz)
* [Mac OS X Intel/32bit](http://msp.ucsd.edu/Software/pd-0.49-1-i386.mac.tar.gz)
* [Debian GNU/Linux](https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/p/puredata/)

If you don't know what version to get [click here](https://www.chiefarchitect.com/support/article/KB-01230/determining-if-your-computer-is-32-bit-or-64-bit.html), if you need a different version [click here](http://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data).

### Watch the video lectures on YouTube

You can stream the videos on YouTube, there are two copies of the lectures on YouTube, this is useful because if one playlist gets taken down you can use the other.

If in the future both playlist get deleted you will be forced to download the video lectures from what I call "the easy way" down below. Of course if you just prefer downloading the lectures rather than streaming them you can do so as well.


### Download the video lectures

To download the lecture videos you have 2 options:

* The easy but slow way, going to 20 websites and manually clicking download on 20 different videos.

or

* The hard but faster way, installing a program that will download the videos for you.

#### The easy way

To download each video lecture click on one lecture from the list below, the right click on the video frame and select 'save video as'.

Then select your video destination.

Come back to this site and repeat this process fro the rest of the lectures.

#### The hard way

You can use a program called 'youtube-dl' to download an entire playlist from YouTube.

First you have to download youtube-dl, if you use windows this repository includes a copy of youtube-dl and instructions,to find them go to 'lectures' and the 'windows'.

1. Go to the youtube-dl downloads page by [clicking here](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html) and follow the installation instructions.
1. Go to the folder where you want to store the videos and open the terminal in that directory.
1. Inside the terminal type 'youtube-dl' followed by a space.
1. Add the link of the YouTube playlist you want to download (remember there are two to choose from).
1. Hit enter and wait for your downloads to finish.
